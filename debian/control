Description: diet libc - a libc optimized for small size
 The diet libc is a C library that is optimized for small size. It
 can be used to create small statically linked binaries for Linux
 on alpha, arm, ia64, mips, mipsel, ppc, parisc, s390, sparc and x86.
 .
 This package is used to compile programs with the diet libc.
 .
 The diet libc also supports dynamic linking, currently on the arm and
 i386 architectures only.  The 'dietlibc' package provides the shared
 libraries.
