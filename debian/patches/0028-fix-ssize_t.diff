Subject: [PATCH] fix ssize_t definition

gcc -Wformat likes to warn if '%zd' is used and ssize_t is not
a signed size_t (several architectures have 'unsigned int' as
their __SIZE_TYPE__ definition); use __SIZE_TYPE__ in the same
way for defining ssize_t as size_t uses (in stddef.h), except
it must, of course, be signed; this actual kludge comes from
$MirOS: src/sys/sys/types.h,v 1.8 2007/05/18 00:47:58 tg Exp $
and is incorporated here with permission of its creator

example build log (mipsel, too) exhibiting this warning:
