dietlibc (0.12-2.2) stable-security; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload by security team
  * Second try actually since it turned out that there were two versions
    of 0.12-2.1, since there can only be one, a new version was required
    for an override.
  * Backport of four security related fixes:
    . Be more strict regarding hostile DNS packets
    . Add integer overflow fix in xdr_array after CERT advisory
      (VU#192995, CAN-2002-0391)
    . Add calloc integer overflow fix after RUS-CERT advisor
    . Add fread and fwrite integer overflow fix
  * Fixed main Makefile to recognize ``sparc64'' as ``sparc''
  * Fixed a dangling reference to a label in lib/alloc.c
  * Corrected maintainer address

dietlibc (0.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mipsel bug in Makefile.add (Closes: #125781)
  * Changed debian rules file so that copyright can be installed
    for architecture dependant files as well (Closes: #124152)

 -- Abraham vd Merwe <abz@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Dec 2001 22:17:51 +0200

dietlibc (0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

    replacing the default diet wrappers (Closes: #120297)

  * I've split the package up into three seperate packages.

 -- Abraham vd Merwe <abz@debian.org>  Thu, 4 Dec 2001 22:19:07 +0200

dietlibc (0.11-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Makefile and debian/rules to use 'uname -m' again in order
    to determine the architecture (Closes: #119715)

 -- Abraham vd Merwe <abz@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Nov 2001 19:50:32 +0200

dietlibc (0.11-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the -EB flag from mips/Makefile.add. The mipsel bug should
    hopefully now be fixed. (Closes: #109209)

 -- Abraham vd Merwe <abz@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Nov 2001 11:11:09 +0200

dietlibc (0.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Makefile and debian/rules to use 'dpkg --print-architecture'
    in order to determine the host architecture (Closes: #109209)
  * Added a rule in debian/rules to remove backup files (Closes: #117273)

 -- Abraham vd Merwe <abz@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Oct 2001 18:29:15 +0200

  * Updated README.Debian
  * Dietlibc will now only build for all the officially supported
    platforms (Closes: #104688)
  * Removed preinst kernel header compatibility hack. Since the new
    dietlibc doesn't depend on the kernel headers, this is not necessary
    anymore.

 -- Abraham vd Merwe <abz@debian.org>  Thu, 2 Aug 2001 00:16:23 +0200

dietlibc (0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low
