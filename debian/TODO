TODO list for dietlibc in Debian
--------------------------------

General:

 - forward all relevant patches upstream and drastically reduce the
   amount we currently carry (should not be more than 5 ideally!)

Package features:

 - Multi-Arch: same support, to allow for cross-compilation from the
   native Debian package
 - debug symbols by default (without package rebuild)
 - reenable dynamic linking support on architectures
   that support it
 - make sure dietlibc uses as many hardening features as possible
   (this has to be done manually, we often can't just pass in
   flags from debhelper, because this is so low-level that future
   additions might break the build)
